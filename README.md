# Fallout-Inspired Interaction and Quest System

This project recreates the intuitive interaction system from Fallout 4 using Unreal Engine 5, C++, and Blueprints. It was developed as a graduation thesis project, mirroring the immersive experience of Fallout 4's interactions and quests.

## üìå Features
- **Precise Interaction System**: Utilizes sphere triggers, sphere casts, and ray casts for accurate object detection and interaction.
- **HUD Prompts**: Displays object names and interaction prompts, mimicking Fallout 4's UI.
- **Grabbing System**: Allows players to pick up and manipulate objects in the game world.
- **Perspective Toggle**: Smooth switching between first and third-person camera views.
- **Dynamic Quest System**: Inspired by open-world games, allowing for non-linear quest completion.
- **Quest Log**: Tracks current and completed objectives.

## üìê Technical Highlights
- Implemented in C++ and Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5
- Meticulously recreated to match Fallout 4's interaction system
- Designed to be easily integrated into larger game projects
